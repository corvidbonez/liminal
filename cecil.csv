"Hello there again. My name is Cecil and you look lost, you can just try to find your way out this endless maze of a school, orrr you can play games with me and every game you win will give you a piece of a guaranteed exit. Oh come on, don't look so confused. I'm talking about tokens."
"Do you want to play a game with me? You shouldn't refuse if you want the information I harbor, the game we will be playing is hide and seek. "
You know how to play right?
Okay lets start then...
1........2........3.......4.......5.......6.......7......8.......9.......10 ready or not here i come to find you.
"Come on out friend I wont hurt you all too much just let me find you and win! I'm only a child, you're really not gonna let a child win? come on pleasee if you don't i'll start crying you know?"
"I feel like I'm getting close to you, just come out, you're not gonna win."
"I know you're starting to get scared friend, just come on out and it will be all over."
"well, well, well looks like you lost my game, now I think it's time I have my fun with you"
"You survived my game, well congratulations I had fun. Now as promised I will give you the information you seek."
"When you beat a game made by one of us ghosts, it fufills the last piece of their unfinished business. Their soul will infuse to a token. A 'soul coin' if you will. It's your duty to deliver them to the afterlife."
"(You stand there, silent)"
Okay well.. bye.
Cecil disappears- slowly disloving into the air around. Something drops onto the floor under where he stood.
