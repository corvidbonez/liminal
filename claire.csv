"Hello, sir! I'm Claire! You seem lost. Do you maybe want to rest a bit and play a game with me?"
(Is this even a choice? ...)
"Okay, sure."
Great! Have a seat. Let's play..
Rock Paper Scissors!!
Ready? 
Hmm should I go with Rock Paper or Scissors: 
"Okay one, two, three ... GO!"
Yayy I won!! hahaha
Aww what! No fair you MUST be a mind reader or something!
Aha!
(Ugh) This is so lame..
A tie.. Hurry let's go again!
*Hmph* (close call..)
The room shifts before your eyes... that's new. But what isn't at this point? *sigh* As you're about to start grabbing your cleaning supplies- (You still have a job to do come on). The room completely resets itself. 
wHaT. Every surface is completely clear and looks brand new. Even the trashcans have been emptied. Oh well. Seems like the ghost children are looking to take over your job too. 
Aw best out of 3..
Well good try! How about best out of 3? ^-^
Oh well.. you're proper opponent! Best out of 3?
One more time!
Phew!
"Well,  I digress. You've earned my token! Thanks for playing... Don't spend it all in one place!"
Aw man, I was looking forward to this! Ok, bye then :c
