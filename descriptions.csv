The elevator rings as you ascend to your floor. You sigh. 
"While you’ve been working as a janitor for many years, the night shift still unsettles you."
"The elevator jolts, breaking you out of your inner turmoil. The doors open to. . .sigh. A familiar creeping feeling washes over you as you set your eyes on yet another hallway."
This job doesn’t seem so new after all. 
"You gave up on turning the lights on years ago, preferring to do your work by flashlight." It allowed you to ignore the feeling that maybe the hallways weren’t as unoccupied they seem.
South: You turn back around to the elevator you just exited. No matter how many times you press the button it will not open for you. Seems like you need to continue forward
East: classroom 305 func
West: Ah yes... your favorite place. Small wooden crates surround an army green breaker box with a classic "Danger⚠️ Electrocution ⚡" design. 
You spot a familiar crate from your line of work. It contains a set of
"Another door comes into view to the east. The door to your west is still visible, and at the end of the hallway you can make out the floresent exit sign. It looks taunting like that, green and unwavering even as the wallpaper peels and yellows around you."
"You enter the next room to your left. It's a classroom with a Bronze plaque on the door marking it as 'Rm 307'. You note the singular desk flanked by two chairs that face one another. You look around but don't spot anything else in particular... That is until you feel a chill down your spine. You turn around hurried."
You could go back the way you came.. but you feel the urge to continue exploring ahead
North (again): stairs yippee! 
"A green neon exit sign illuminates a door you presume leads to the stairs. Since the elevator is broken, it's your only way out. However you're saddened to notice the door is locked... and with a strange mechanism that requires two tokens to unlock. You'll need to find them first to open the door :3"
"While it really is a shame that the elevator is broken, taking the stairs down a level is hardly the worst thing you've had to do in this line of work."
"Not to mention after the rollercoaster of a floor you just had to deal with, you can't imagine having to stand still while you anxiously await for the doors to ding at the correct floor. Nope. Not happening."
The stairs apruptly end as you realize you've made it to your next floor. You sigh.
"As you approach the stairs, you notice the tokens have spots to slot in and unlock the door. Slotting Cecil's and Claire's tokens in illuminates the door handle with a golden glow for a moment- and then it's gone."
You look farther down the hallway. The droning fluorescents are really getting on your nerves. In the shadows of dark corners you swear you can see writhing movements- but they disapear the second you turn toward them with your mop in hand.
"There seem to be two different doors. One seems to lead to the jannitor's closet; the other to a classroom with a Silver plaque marking it as 'Rm 203'."
"Game Ending: The room resets itself, black mold receding from the wallpaper, cobwebs disinegrating from the corners. The room probably is cleaner than it has been in years."
"The glares of the ghosts increase ten-fold. They don't seem happy that their leader was beaten. Vera laughs humourlessly and the temperature drops."
On the ground there sits a gleaming object. Upon closer inspection...
"There are two doors to your left. One seems to lead to the janitor's closet; the other to a classroom."
It appears you're having trouble opening the door; you might be missing a few things. You decide to head back and look around some more...
"You realize with a sickening feeling that this time- you had no choice to enter this classroom. From your current position, you cant even see the room number. What you can see though is that this room is much darker than all the others. Although you cant see it, corruption seems to leak from every shadowed corner."
"A classroom with a Copper plaque marking it as 'Rm 305'. As you enter, ready to start "
"As you walk into the janitors closet you feel a chill unlike any other, it's not cold but you feel a sense of sadness in the room and your limbs start to feel heavy. As you look up from the ground you see this child just standing in the middle of the room. Then, just before you're able to speak she jumps at you- making you take a step back and stumble. As you try to recover from the ground, that sense of sadness and coldness is gone; like it just vanished somehow. You look all around to find yourself alone in the room."
