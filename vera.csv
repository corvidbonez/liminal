"Surprise, Surprise. Seems like Hugh didn't finish you off after all. Never mind that, he was always the soft one and he's gone now anyway. Well then. I suppose it is your last game. I offer you a cold welcome."
"Understand that it will be difficult, and nobody, including myself is betting on you winning."

"Listen closely. The rules are simple. All you have to do is roll a die. If you can roll a higher number than me, you win."

You catch the end of someones sentence: "such a chea-"
*Vera turns to the crowd of students* Are you calling me a cheater?! I would never do such a thing. Prove it so and I will let you win. I hate cheaters.
May I see your die?
If you must.
"*Rolls both dice many times, Vera's always rolls higher.* See- I'm not one to call people out, but this game is rigged."
Fine. You are correct. >:(
"Ohhhh well now you'll get it! Let's be honest, they don't respect you, and they love me."
The students around the room charge towards Vera. They look livid. Seeing her knocked off her pedestal finally give them an oppertunity to deliver her to a long awaited bitter end.
You've completed Liminal's: Spaces.
"On behalf of all the developers, thank you. We put a lot of time into this and it is a joy to share it with people willing to play."
